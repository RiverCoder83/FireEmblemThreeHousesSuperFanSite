# FireEmblemThreeHousesSuperFanSite
Designed and coded a responsive website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase the nations and some of the characters in one of my favorite video games, Fire Emblem: Three Houses. This project involved brainstorming, designing, testing for UX improvements, and coding the final site.
